- Overview

This is a Flutter-based Quiz Application that allows users to answer multiple-choice questions and see their final score after completing the quiz. It consists of several components including questions, answers, result display, and the main app logic.

- Project Structure
1. `main.dart`  
   The entry point for the app, responsible for initializing the app and managing the state of the quiz, including questions and user responses. It uses the `Quiz` and `Result` widgets to display the question interface and final results.

2. `quiz.dart`  
   A widget that displays the question and corresponding answers. It takes in a list of questions, the current index of the question, and a callback function to handle the user's answer selection.

3. `question.dart`  
   This widget displays the text for each question. It is designed to show the question content passed to it via its constructor.

4. `answer.dart`  
   A widget that displays each answer option as a button. It accepts a function and the answer text to handle user interaction.

5. `result.dart`  
   Displays the user's final score after completing the quiz. It shows a message with the total score achieved.

6. `answer.txt` & `answer.dart`  
   Both files define the answer widget, which is used to display the answer options as clickable buttons. The difference between them is primarily their location, with `answer.txt` serving as a placeholder or documentation file, while `answer.dart` holds the actual widget code.

7. `question.dart`  
   Contains a stateless widget that renders each questionâ€™s text.
